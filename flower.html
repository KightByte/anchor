      <p>Just kidding! Of course I got you flowers silly. I even made sure they were your favorite. I hope they smell as fresh and sweet as you do. I picked them for you because on a day so special you deserve something soft to cheer your heart up a bit. Today may be special and warrent these petals but please dont be mistaken. Not a day passes where I dont think of you enough to overload computers. If I could make it happen you would recieve something that carrys the same beautiful meaning as these every day sweetie. I love you</p>
